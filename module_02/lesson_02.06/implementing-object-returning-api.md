The last thing we need to do to make the structure of our `react-hanger` clone closer to the original is to implement the same hooks, but ones returning objects instead of arrays.

So, that is it. This will be enough to get a fully-working example hooks library. Of course, it has only two hooks rather than all of the hooks in `react-hanger`, but if you're interested in digging into the implementation details,  head to the `react-hanger` repository and check it out yourself. Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is unclear!

Let's wrap up this module. In the next one we're going to discuss different module systems, bundlers and other tooling that prepares our code to be consumed as a sharable library.
