title: Setting up development environment
isPublicLesson: true

In this first lesson we will set up the development environment you need for the course. I assume most students will already have it all installed.

In short you need:

- the latest long-term supported version of **Node** (version 14 at the time this course was created)
- Git installed on your machine 
- a code editor of your choice


If you don't have Node installed head to [Nodejs.org.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If you don't have an editor we suggest you install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is free to use and is overwhelmingly the editor of choice in the JavaScript community.

You can install it via DETAILED INSTRUCTION HERE

I'll be using the [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) editor for the rest of this course as I'm most familiar with it.
