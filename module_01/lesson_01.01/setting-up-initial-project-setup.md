title: Setting up initial project setup
isPublicLesson: true

The first step is to grab the code for this lesson, as previously described. Create the folder anywhere you feel is convenient and copy and paste the code. I recommend avoiding the Desktop or Downloads folder as they may get cleaned up quite often and you don't want your code to be cleaned away!

Go to your new folder using the terminal of your choice, or open this folder using your editor, and then execute `npm init` to initialize our base `package.json` file.

At the prompts we'll select `react-hanger`, suggested version, author self-explanatory, license MIT - default for everything.

Good - now you should see `package.json` in the root folder of your project. For now, delete `main` from our package.json. We'll address that in later modules.

That's it! Next we're going to set up ESLint and Prettier.
